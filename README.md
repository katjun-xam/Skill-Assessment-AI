#### The difference compared with UI Kits like MaterialUI, is that each components are easily customisable to suits every projects needs. They intergate well on XAM's typical projects setup and don't bring any extra dependencies, helping keeping a simple and clean codebase.

# Getting Started

The components library is contained into a Storybook.

To run storybook you'll need nodeJS https://nodejs.org/en/
From inside the React/library folder run:

        yarn install or npm install

Then run:

        yarn storybook or npm storybook

# Storybook explorer

Navigate through the Storybook sidebar (shortcut 's') and reveal the addons bar (shortcut 'a')
Each component parameters could be tweaked for demo purpose from the addons panel while each sidebar story contains most of the combinations that a component's offers
